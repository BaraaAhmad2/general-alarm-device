# Firmware Folder

These folders contain files as follows:

* GPAD_API is the firmware which goes into the GPAD microcontroller.
* GPAD_API_TEST is a test file and instructions for usering Realrerm to be an endurance test of the GPAD serial port interface. It endlessly sends a simple set of commands to the GPAD which are in a simple text file.
* GPAD_Factory_Test is .ino file to be loaded into the GPAD for factory testing and or troubleshooting. Was developed to test Version 1 PCBs and was developed on Wokwi. (Was fun to do!)
* SPI_Controller_And_Peripherial... is a ?link? to an external github repository for some SPI communications proof of concept files 
* pseudoSerialVent is a simulated ventelator made in the Proccessing IDE with which to test the GPAD when loaded with formware GPAD_API
