## Documentation

## Enclosure
The Version 1 enclosure is mostly designed in OPEN SCAD  
Files to fabricate an enclosure are detailed in this document: [LINK](./Enclosure/README.md)

## GeneralPurposeAlarmDevicePCB
Includes the KiCad files for schemtic and PCBs.
The most recent schematic is: [Schematic-GeneralPurposeAlarmDevicePCB-V1.2pdf.pdf](/Hardware/GeneralPurposeAlarmDevicePCB/PDF/Schematic-GeneralPurposeAlarmDevicePCB-V1.2pdf.pdf)

## Manufacturing
Includes the spread sheets for Bill of Materials (BOMs) to fabricate the GeneralPurposeAlarmDevicePCB

## PolyVent_SPI_Controller
Includes KiCad schematic and PCB files for an adapter PCB to fit into PolyVent and provide an SPI (and I2C) interface to other devices. The SPI interface is for the GPAD.
