# PolyVent SPI Controller Card
This project is a printed circuit assembly which fits in to the card rack of the PolyVent
This assembly brings out an SPI (Serial Peripherial Interface) on an RJ12 connector compatable with the GPAD.
This assembly brings out an I2C (Inter Integrated Circuit interface) on a 4 pin JST connector similar to the GPAD.
